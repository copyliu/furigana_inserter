# Furigana Inserter #
Furigana Inserter is an add-on for the web browser [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com). It automatically inserts furigana for words written in kanji. Furigana are small characters written in kana or romaji which appear above kanji. They tell you how to read the kanji.

Furigana Inserter uses [MeCab: Yet Another Part-of-Speech and Morphological Analyzer](http://mecab.sourceforge.net/) to translate kanji to kana.

Furigana Inserter is able to monitor the clipboard for changes. When a change is detected, text from the clipboard is inserted into the browser page, then furigana is inserted into the text.

Furigana Inserter can also look up words in a dictionary and display a translation in a popup window. The Rikaichan add-on is required for this to work.

It can be used to play Japanese games especially visual novels by using it together with ITH or AGTH.

## Requirements ##
  * Furigana Inserter works on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. I have only tested it on Windows and Linux.
  * [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com). Firefox >= 38 has built-in support for ruby (furigana).
  * Furigana Inserter requires a dictionary in order to work. See [FAQ](FAQ.md) for installation instructions.
  * Furigana Inserter can use [Rikaichan's dictionaries](http://rikaichan.mozdev.org/getdic2.html) in order to show a translation in a popup window for the word under the cursor. Rikaichan itself is not required.

## Recommended Software ##
  * [JWPCE](http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~grosenth/jwpce.html) is a good free Japanese word processor for Windows. It has a lot of useful features for students of the Japanese language.
  * [AGTH](http://sites.google.com/site/agthook/) Anime Games Text Hooker is a program for capturing text from running programs. You can use it to copy the text from Japanese computer games into the clipboard.
  * [ITH](http://code.google.com/p/interactive-text-hooker/) Interactive Text Hooker (ITH) is a tool to help you extract text from Japanese games.
