=Tips and Tricks for using Furigana Inserter=

== General information ==
You can customize the style of the dictionary popup and of Japanese words using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS CSS]. You need to put the CSS code either in the file `chrome\userContent.css` or `chrome\userChrome.css` in the Firefox profile directory. On Windows it is located in the directory `%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles`. You can copy and paste this path into the Windows Explorer address bar.

== Customizing the style of words ==
The following rules have to be added to `chrome\userContent.css`. This CSS rule will introduce space between Japanese words, if you are using katakana or hiragana:
{{{
span.fi {
    padding-left: 0.3ex !important;
    padding-right: 0.3ex !important
}
}}}
If you are using romaji then you need to use the following rule:
{{{
ruby {
    padding-left: 0.3ex !important;
    padding-right: 0.3ex !important
}
}}}

== Customizing the dictionary popup ==
The following rules have to be added to `chrome\userChrome.css`.

To remove the information about a kanji like the number of strokes etc. use this rule:
{{{
#rikaichan-popup .k-abox-tb {
    display: none;
}
}}}

Change the font size of the kanji to 24 pixel:
{{{
#rikaichan-popup .k-kanji {
    font-size: 24px !important;
}
}}}

Change the maximum width of the popup to 600 pixel, the height is set to automatic per default:
{{{
#rikaichan-popup {
    max-width: 600px !important;
}
}}}

Change the width of the kanji table to 150 pixel:
{{{
#rikaichan-popup .k-main-tb {
    width: 150px !important;
}
}}}
