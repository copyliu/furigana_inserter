== Switching dictionaries ==
When the popup with the translation is displayed, you can press `Shift` or `Enter` to switch to the next dictionary.

== General information ==
You can customize the style of the dictionary popup and of Japanese words using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS CSS]. You need to put the CSS code either in the file `chrome\userContent.css` in the Firefox profile directory. On Windows it is located in the directory `%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles`. You can copy and paste this path into the Windows Explorer address bar.

== Customizing the style of words ==
The following rules have to be added to `chrome\userContent.css`. This CSS rule will introduce space between Japanese words, if you are using katakana or hiragana:
{{{
span.fi {
    padding-left: 0.2em !important;
    padding-right: 0.2em !important
}
}}}
If you are using romaji then you need to use the following rule:
{{{
ruby {
    padding-left: 0.2em !important;
    padding-right: 0.2em !important
}
}}}

You can lookup a word in the dictionary by selecting it and pressing *Ctrl+G*.

==Appearance of Ruby==
To change the appearance of furigana go to "Format > Asian Phonetic Guide" There, under "Character style for ruby text", should be "Rubies" selected. If you click on the "Styles" button, then right click on any of the styles in the list (ie. Rubies), you can modify the font, size, effects, and also get rid of the grey background in the furigana boxes ("background" tab, and choose to fill with white).
