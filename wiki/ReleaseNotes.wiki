= Release Notes =
==05.11.2009 Furigana Inserter 1.0.4==
  * Made compatible with Firefox 3.6
  * Fixed: furigana was inserted in the wrong tab, if "process every page automatically" was turned on and user reloaded a tab through right-click menu.
  * Integrated part of the HTML Ruby add-on. Now Furigana Inserter will render the ruby elements itself if the HTML Ruby add-on is not installed and Firefox is version 3.5 or higher. If you have Firefox 3.5 or higher and FI 1.0.4, then you don't need the HTML Ruby add-on.
  * Added support for a user dictionary. The option "extensions.furiganainserter.user_dic_path" is only accessible through "about:options". This is a feature for advanced users.
  * Changed defaults: FI now uses words for lookup and splits Japanese into words per default
  * Removed option to not insert furigana for links from the options dialog. Still accessible through "about:config".

==18.08.2009 Furigana Inserter 1.0.3==
This is a minor update.
 * Fixed: Selection was removed even in the "use word" mode.
 * Fixed: Word lookup didn't work in Firefox 3.5 with dynamically inserted ruby.

==15.07.2009 Furigana Inserter 1.0.2==
This is a major update.
 * Added: You can now choose between hiragana, katakana and romaji for furigana alphabet.
 * Added: Furigana Inserter can now split Japanese into words. You can change the style of those words in `chrome\userContent.css` in your Firefox profile directory.
 * Furigana Inserter can now look up words and display the translation in a popup just like Rikaichan. [https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/2471 Rikaichan] needs to be installed for that to work. There are two lookup modes:
  # If Furigana Inserter is configured to split words then a word can be used for lookup. Just move the mouse cursor somewhere into the word.
  # Furigana Inserter can lookup the word that follows the cursor, just like Rikaichan. It will ignore all markup in the word, including ruby (furigana).

==31.05.2009 Furigana Inserter 1.0.1==

 * Fixed: Other small bugs.

==24.05.2009 Furigana Inserter 1.0.0==
