This is a minor update.
 * Fixed: Selection was removed even in the "use word" mode.

==15.07.2009 Furigana Inserter 1.0.2==
This is a major update.
 * Added: You can now choose between hiragana, katakana and romaji for furigana alphabet.
 * Added: Furigana Inserter can now split Japanese into words. You can change the style of those words in `chrome\userContent.css` in your Firefox profile directory.
 * Furigana Inserter can now look up words and display the translation in a popup just like Rikaichan. [https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/2471 Rikaichan] needs to be installed for that to work. There are two lookup modes:
  # If Furigana Inserter is configured to split words then a word can be used for lookup. Just move the mouse cursor somewhere into the word.
  # Furigana Inserter can lookup the word that follows the cursor, just like Rikaichan. It will ignore all markup in the word, including ruby (furigana).
