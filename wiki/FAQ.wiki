=Frequently Asked Questions=

== What is the keywords mode?==
The keywords mode introduced in FI 2.0 allows inserting a keywords for a kanji instead of the reading. A list of english keywords is available for download. You have to copy and paste the list into the keywords dialog. You can find it in "Tools->Furigana Inserter->Keywords...".

==Why does all kanji disappear when I remove furigana from a web page?==
This happens when you use the HTML Ruby add-on 6. To prevent this problem you should disable the option "Process inserted content" of the HTML Ruby add-on.

==How do I install a dictionary for Furigana Inserter?==
There are two ways to install a dictionary required by Furigana Inserter.
 # The first option is to install the dictionary add-on for Firefox.
  # Download the file `furiganainserter-dictionary-<version>.7z` and unpack it with [http://www.7-zip.org 7-Zip] or WinRAR.
  # Then either drag and drop the unpacked file `furiganainserter-dictionary.xpi` into a Firefox window or go the `File` menu in Firefox, choose `Open File...` and select the file `furiganainserter-dictionary.xpi`.
 # Second option is to install [http://code.google.com/p/mecab/downloads/list MeCab] instead of the dictionary add-on.
  # If you are on Windows then download `mecab-<version>.exe` where `<version>` is the version number.
  # During the installation choose the UTF-8 format.

==How do I change the font size of ruby (furigana)?==
The HTML Ruby add-on allows you to change the font size of ruby (furigana). Go to the `Tools` menu, select `Add-ons` then select `HTML Ruby` and choose `Options`. There you will find the option `Ruby text size`.

==What about Linux and Mac OS X?==
Since version 2.0 Furigana Inserter should work on Linux and Mac OS X. Firefox version 4 or higher is required. The dictionary add-on should also work. I have only tested it on Linux and Windows.

The user dictionary will only work with the IPAdic dictionary. You have to install either !MeCab with a dictionary or !MeCab and the dictionary add-on for Firefox. You should use the UTF-8 encoding for the !MeCab dictionary.

To install FI 2.7 on Fedora 18 64-bit:
  # Drag and drop `furigana-inserter-<version>.xpi` file into Firefox.
  # `sudo yum install mecab mecab-ipadic`
  # `sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libmecab.so.2 /usr/lib64/libmecab.so.1`
